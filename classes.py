# # Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
#
# # Everything in OOP is an object are modelled against real world objects.
#
# # Classes are templates we use to create objects
# # Classes are way of bringing both data and functionality of our code together
#
# # Create a class
#
# class Dog:
#
#     animal_Kind = "canine" # class variable
#
#     def bark(self): # method
#         return "woof"
#
# # self - referring to the current class to access variables and methods
#
# # print(Dog().animal_Kind)
# # print(Dog().bark())
#
# # Instantiation of a class
#
# fido = Dog()
# lassie = Dog()
#
# print(type(fido))
# print(type(lassie))
